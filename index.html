    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>This is the first test document made as a part of the Odin project.</p>
    <h2>My Background</h2>
    <p>I've already taken CS courses and know most of this so I'm kind of zooming through the HTML stuff right now.</p>
    <h2>Some Stuff</h2>
    <p>What about a list?</p>
    <ol>
        <li>First item.</li>
        <li>Second item.
            <ul>
                <li>Nested point under second item.
                    <ol>
                        <li>How deep</li>
                        <li>does this</li>
                        <li>list go!?</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>Nested point under second item.</li>
                <li>Final nested point under second item.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Third item.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Maybe we should try a link. Lets see, what should I link to ... maybe ...
        <a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferer">Google</a>?
    </p>
    <p>Interestingly this is the first I've heard of "<strong>rel="noopener noreferer"</strong>" aspect of an anchor tag.
        It apparently stops the opened page from messing with the page that opened it. Why you could even do that in the first place is beyond me.
    </p>
    <p>Now I want to link to another page. One within my own file structure. Something local. Known as ...
        <a href="./pages/some_page.html"><em>some page</em></a>.
    </p>
    <p>How about a sweet image? Or even, <em>two</em> sweet images ...</p>
